# BamboozleBoxScript
A script to trick hackers with a bunch of annoying music like a siren and Baby Shark. Bonus: they get rickrolled

This script is a part of the Honeypot project in CSI 3480 with team members Christina M., Kevin T., and Dylan C.

Script created by Christina, we hope you like it and that it would teach hackers a lesson!
